# Bupsy

A [Kivy](http://kivy.org/) multitouch game of flying bouncing letters. Touch a letter to hear its sound.

## Requirements

* Python 2.7
* Kivy (see [installation notes] http://kivy.org/docs/gettingstarted/installation.html)

## Deployment

* This game can be deployed to your favourite Android or iOS device. See http://kivy.org/docs/guide/packaging.html for details.

## Quick deployment

* The files in this repository can also be deployed directly to an Android device and run using the [Kivy Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kivy.pygame&hl=en). See http://kivy.org/docs/guide/packaging-android.html#packaging-your-application-for-kivy-launcher for details.

## Acknowledgements

* The letter sounds currently come from the [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org) project. The plan is to record phonic sounds rather than the names of the letters.
